## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Audrey, a web developer from Toulouse - France, with 11 years' experience.

In a few key words:

- Frameworks / Libraries: ReactJS, Remix (https://remix.run/), GatsbyJS (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- Tools & testing: Webpack, Storybook, Jest, Cypress.
- Concepts: PWA, Responsive webdesign, BEM, Atomic design, accessibility (the Opquast accessibility checklist FTW!), notions of natural referencing.

STACK BACK:
----------------
- Node, PHP / MySQL
- Frameworks / Libraries: Symfony, ApiPlatform
- ECommerce: Sylius, Magento 2
- Testing: PHPUnit

Other: Docker, jenkins, Ansible, Git...

I like to follow Uncle Bob's advice to code as cleanly as possible:
